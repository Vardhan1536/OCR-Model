## <a id="overview"></a> *Overview*

*PaddleOCR* is an advanced toolkit for optical character recognition that allows users to extract text from images and documents. The toolkit includes multiple pre-trained models for:

- Text Detection
- Text Direction Classification
- Text Recognition

PaddleOCR supports multiple languages such as Latin, Arabic, Traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, making it a versatile tool for global applications.

## <a id="paddleocr-features"></a> *PaddleOCR Features*

- üñº *Text Detection*: Detects text areas in images and generates bounding boxes around them.
- üî§ *Text Recognition*: Recognizes and extracts text content within the detected regions.
- üîÑ *Vertical Text Detection*: Detects rotated or vertically aligned text.
- üìè *Handling Long Text*: Optimized to recognize longer blocks of text.
- ‚¨Ü *Angle Classification*: Automatically detects and corrects the text's orientation.
- üì∏ *High-Resolution Text Detection*: Supports high-res input for detecting small and large text accurately.

## <a id="model-architecture"></a> *Model Architecture*

*PP-OCRv3*

- *Text Detection* is based on the *Differentiable Binarization (DB)* algorithm, trained with a distillation strategy for high accuracy.
- *Text Recognition* leverages the *Scene Text Recognition with a Single Visual Model (SVTR)*, as outlined by Du et al. (2022).

---

## <a id="implementation-workflow"></a> *Implementation Workflow*

The *Optimuz* project utilizes the *PaddleOCR* model to process images and extract text content. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. *Image Input*: The image is fed into the OCR model.
2. *Text Detection*: Bounding boxes are generated around the detected text areas.
3. *Text Recognition*: Extracts the actual text from the regions inside the bounding boxes (if recognition is enabled).
4. *JSON Output*: The model generates a JSON file containing the detected text, bounding box coordinates, and confidence scores.

## <a id="model-fine-tuning-for-vertical-and-long-text"></a> *Model Fine-tuning for Vertical and Long Text*

While PaddleOCR excels at detecting horizontal text, several adjustments were made to enhance performance for vertical and lengthy text:

- **use_angle_cls=True**: Enables detection and correction of rotated or vertically aligned text.
- **det_db_box_thresh=0.2**: Lowers the detection threshold to increase sensitivity for text detection.
- **det_db_unclip_ratio=2.5**: Increases the unclip ratio to capture larger text areas.
- **lang='en'**: Specifies the language to be used (English in this case).
- **rec=False**: Disables the text recognition component (if only detection is required).
- **det_limit_side_len=1536**: Sets a maximum side length for detected text to handle high-resolution images.

## *Student Results Chatbot with RAG Integration*

We are expanding the chatbot functionality by integrating *RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)*, enabling the model to provide a structured format of student marklists. This process involves several key steps:

---

### *How It Works:*

#### *1. Data Collection and Processing:*
- We utilize *OCR (Optical Character Recognition)* to extract unstructured data from marklist images.
- Simultaneously, structured data is retrieved from the university‚Äôs marks database.

#### *2. Creating a Training Dataset:*
- Since there is no pre-existing, structured dataset for
  ```
  ## *Structured Marklist Integration with RAG Model*

We are integrating a *RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)* model to convert unstructured student marklist images into a structured format. Here's the process:

---

### *1. Dataset Creation:*
- Using *OCR*, unstructured data is extracted from university marklist images.
- Structured data is obtained from the university's marks database.

### *2. Model Training:*
- The *RAG model* is trained on this data to learn the conversion from unstructured to structured format.

### *3. Chatbot Integration:*
- Once trained, the *RAG model* will be integrated into our chatbot, enabling it to provide accurate, structured responses based on user queries.



## *App.js - Prototype Overview*

The *App.js* is the user interface prototype for our project, hosted on *Streamlit*. It allows users to interact with the OCR model and chatbot. Key features include:

- *Image Upload*: Users can upload marklist image files.
- *JSON Preview & Download*: The app generates a JSON file from the image data, previews it, and allows users to download it.
- *Chatbot Interaction*: Users can chat with the bot to ask questions and resolve queries.
- *JSON Conversion*: The app provides options to convert the JSON file to Excel or CSV format.
- *API Key Generation*: Users can generate an API key to access the model programmatically.
